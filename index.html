        <p>Hey There üëã</p>
        <p>
          I am Nikhil Tanwar and I love building aesthetically pleasing
          websites. I enjoy Front End Development and experimenting with new
          technologies and tools. I absolutely love React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love creating new prototypes in Adobe XD and then focusing on
          pixel perfect implementation. I always experiment with new color
          palettes and gradients to enhance overall look and feel of websites
          while specifically emphasizing on building engaging content.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it's not just coding that I do all day long. I am a
          realistic person and not some android programmed to script
          continuously. I absolutely love music. While working - I go for Lofi
          and after work - Linkin Park. It would not be wrong to say I'm a
          music geek. What next? Oh! I just love Pizza üçï I think it's the
          greatest thing that has happended to the food industry. Through all
          ups and downs, Pizza is what keeps me going. What else? I'm learning
          to cook nowadays. üë©‚Äçüç≥
        </p>
        <p>
          I am under the process of continuous growth and development. I am no
          expert or a person with ultra legendary Web Dev skills. I am just
          committed towards learning new things and implementing them
          pragmatically to boost up my development comptencies. There's a lot
          to learn and I believe that a cycle of continuous progression would
          help me in becoming a competent Full Stack Developer‚≠ê
